# Model Direct - Planning Notes

## Project Status: Planning / Research Phase

---

## Problem Insights (From Anna + Industry Knowledge)

### The Hidden Markup Scam
- Brands pay agents £1,000 for a model
- Agents tell model "you're getting £150-200/day"
- Agent pockets £800+ (80%!) disguised as "25% commission"
- Model thinks this is normal because they don't know market rates

### Why Models Accept Low Rates
- "Ordinary models" (commercial, not supermodels) don't know what brands actually pay
- Agents convince them £150-200/day is good because "you could get your big break"
- Models are kept in the dark about true market rates
- Fear of losing work if they push back

### The Cheap Model Arbitrage
- Agents push models they know will work cheap
- But the cost savings aren't passed to brands
- Brands still pay full rate (£1,000)
- Agent pockets the difference (£800 instead of £300)
- Everyone loses except the agent

### Multiple Agent Problem
- Models sign with 20+ agents to get more work
- Same job comes through 3 different agents at different rates
- Creates confusion and missed opportunities
- Agents don't coordinate - they compete against each other using the same model

## Market Opportunity

### Why Now?
- Instagram/TikTok have made models discoverable
- Brands are used to booking direct (influencers)
- Gig economy has normalized transparent marketplaces
- Models are more aware they're being exploited (social media discussion)

### Target Market (Phase 1)
- UK commercial/advertising models
- Not high fashion (too gatekept)
- Brands: E-commerce, advertising agencies, small/mid brands
- Day rate range: £500-2,000

## Validation Questions

### For Models
- [ ] What % of your agent's stated commission do you believe is accurate?
- [ ] Have you ever found out a brand paid more than you were told?
- [ ] Would you book direct if you had payment protection?
- [ ] What's your biggest fear about leaving agents?

### For Brands
- [ ] What do you typically pay per model per day?
- [ ] Would you book direct if you had verified, professional models?
- [ ] What's your biggest frustration with agencies?
- [ ] How much time do you spend on casting?

## Notes / Brain Dump

*Add new insights here as they come in*

### 2026-01-04
- Ordinary models don't know market rates, so agents exploit this
- "Big break" narrative used to justify low pay
- Agents push cheap models but don't pass savings to brands
- Both models AND brands are being exploited - agents win both ways

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Validate with 10+ models (Anna's network)
2. [ ] Validate with 5+ brands/agencies
3. [ ] Map out exact user journeys
4. [ ] Define MVP feature set
5. [ ] Technical architecture
6. [ ] Build Phase 1
